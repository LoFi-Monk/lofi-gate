# The Ledger

**Verification is Currency.**

The Ledger (`verification_history.md`) is the central accounting system for LoFi Gate. It tracks two things:

1.  **Truth**: Did your tests pass or fail?
2.  **Cost**: How many tokens did you spend (or save) finding that out?

## 📍 Location

The Ledger is always located at the **Project Root**:
`./verification_history.md`

> [!NOTE]
> **For Humans & Agents**
> This log is designed to be read by both. It uses Markdown formatting, emojis, and interactive HTML elements. It works best when viewed in a Markdown previewer or by an LLM Agent.

## 📝 The Format

Each entry is a transaction record:

```markdown
- **[TIMESTAMP]** [COMMAND] ✅ **Label**: STATUS (Duration) (Metrics)
```

- **TIMESTAMP**: When the check ran.
- **COMMAND**: The exact command executed (e.g., `[npm test]`, `[cargo audit]`).
- **Label**: Functional name of the check (e.g., "Test Suite").
- **STATUS**: `PASS` or `FAIL`.
- **Metrics**: `(total token size: 500) (tokens truncated: 0)`

## 💰 Smart Truncation (The Savings)

When a test fails, modern tools spit out thousands of lines of noise.
LoFi Gate captures this output but **truncates** the middle section if it's too long.

**Why?**

- **Context Window**: Providing 10k lines of logs pushes useful code out of the model's memory.
- **Cost**: You pay for every input token. Spam logs = burning money.

### Interactive Debugging

To keep the log clean, these errors are wrapped in **Interactive Dropdowns**:

<details>
<summary>🔍 View Truncated Error</summary>

```text
Error: Something exploded in the core reactor.
...
... [Truncated 12,000 chars] ...
...
Final memory dump: 0xDEADBEEF
```

</details>

_Agents can request to "expand" this if they need the deep trace, but usually the Head + Tail is enough._

## 📊 The "Sticky" Footer

At the bottom of the Ledger, you will always find the **Running Balance**:

> 📊 **Total Token Size:** 3625 | 💰 **Total Token Savings:** 2996

- **Total Token Size**: The cumulative amount of text (tokens) generated by your tools.
- **Total Token Savings**: The cumulative amount of text _avoided_ (deleted) by the Smart Truncation engine.

**This number represents raw profit in API costs and Context Window efficiency.**
