**The Context-Preserving Test Runner for AI Agents**

> "Strong verification loops guide the agent toward the desired result... abstracting away much of the noise that would otherwise consume the agent’s precious context window." — _Spotify Engineering_

AiVerify is a high-performance verification proxy designed for the era of agentic software development. It acts as an intelligent "Inner Loop" verifier, ensuring your AI pair (Claude, GPT, Antigravity) receives the pure **Signal** it needs to ship, without the toxic **Noise** of verbose terminal logs.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

Standard Coding Agents fail in two main ways:

1.  **Context Bloat**: Agents often read _every_ test file just to understand how to run them. This wastes tokens and distracts the model with irrelevant code.
2.  **Cheating**: When faced with a failure, Agents often modify the test itself to force a pass, rather than fixing the bug.

**The Solution**: AiVerify standardizes the entry point to enforce a strict, project-owned verification workflow that the agent cannot circumvent.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. Eliminating Context Bloat (The "Speed Lane")

Agents run `npm run test:agent` (if configured) to execute tools like `jest --onlyChanged`.

- **Result**: The Agent verifies code in seconds, scanning only relevant files.

### 2. Smart Truncation

The script buffers output to prevent token overflow and context exhaustion.

- **Success**: Prints `✅ Verified` (hides 1000s of lines of logs).
- **Failure**: Prints only the last 100 lines of the error.

### 3. Parallel Execution & Auto-Retry

- **Parallelism**: Automatically runs Lint, Security, and Tests concurrently for instant feedback.
- **Flake Protection**: Automatically retries a failed test command once before reporting it to the agent, reducing friction from flaky tests.

## 🛡️ Advanced Gates ("The Iron Man Suite")

![Iron Man Suite Gates](gates.png)

AiVerify blindly enforces these project rules if conditions are met:

- **Gate 1: Security Scan**: If `package.json` exists, it runs `npm audit --audit-level=high`. Blocks on Critical/High vulnerabilities.
- **Gate 2: Strict TDD Enforcer**: Checks `git status` for new implementation files. Fails with "STRICT TDD VIOLATION" if code is created without a corresponding test file.
- **Gate 3: Coverage Check**: If a `coverage` script exists, it ensures thresholds are met before allowing a passage.

## Visual Proof: Signal vs. Noise

### ❌ The Old Way (Toxic Noise)

```text
$ npm test
> project@1.0.0 test
> jest

 PASS  test/auth.test.js (1.2s)
 PASS  test/utils.test.js (0.8s)
 PASS  test/api.test.js (2.1s)
 ... [500 lines of passing details] ...
Test Suites: 15 passed, 15 total
Tests:       84 passed, 84 total
Time:        4.5s
```

### ✅ The AiVerify Way (Pure Signal)

```text
$ python aiverify.py --parallel
🚀 Running 4 checks in PARALLEL...
----------------------------------------
✅ TDD Check Passed! (0.10s)
✅ Security Scan Passed! (1.20s)
✅ Lint Check Passed! (0.85s)
✅ Test Suite Passed! (2.10s)
----------------------------------------
✨ All systems go!
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

Move `aiverify.py` into your `scripts/` directory or project root.

### Usage

```bash
python aiverify.py --parallel
```

### Flags

- `--parallel`: Run independent checks (Lint, Security, Test) concurrently.
- `--serial`: Run checks one by one (default, handles fail-fast cases).

## ⚙️ Configuration

AiVerify respects your standard tool configurations.

**To set a Coverage Threshold (Jest example):**

```json
"jest": {
  "coverageThreshold": { "global": { "lines": 90 } }
}
```

**Standard Node Integration:**
Add to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "npm run verify",
  "verify": "python scripts/aiverify.py --parallel",
  "test:agent": "jest --onlyChanged",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "coverage": "jest --coverage"
}
```

## The Full Suite Strategy

AiVerify is designed to be Part 1 of an **Inescapable Quality Harness** for AI Agents. To replicate our "Spotify-grade" results, we recommend this 4-Layer approach:

### Layer 0: Project Configuration ( The Foundation)

Before enforcing gates, you must map the territory for the Agent.
**Action**: Update your `package.json` to define the standard and the "Speed Lane".

```json
"scripts": {
  "verify": "python aiverify.py --parallel",  // The Main Gate
  "test": "npm run verify",                   // Redirect standard test
  "test:agent": "jest --onlyChanged"          // ⚡ THE SPEED LANE
}
```

- **Why `test:agent`?**: This is crucial. It tells the Agent: _"Only test what I changed."_ It prevents the agent from reading 500 irrelevant files, saving massive amounts of context and tokens.

### Layer 1: Local Gates (AiVerify)

- **Goal**: Enforcement.
- **Tool**: `aiverify.py` + Husky.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install Husky: `npm install husky --save-dev && npx husky init`
  2. Add Pre-Push Hook: `echo "npm run verify" > .husky/pre-push`
     _Result: The Agent cannot push "noisy" or broken code to the server._

### Layer 2: Repo Rules (The Hard Block)

- **Goal**: Prevent Bypassing.
- **Tool**: GitHub/GitLab Branch Protection.
- **Configuration**:
  - **Require Pull Request**: Ensure no direct pushes to `main`.
  - **Require Status Checks**: Force CI to pass before merging.
  - **Do Only**: prevent admins from bypassing rules.
    _Result: Even if the Agent tries to use `--no-verify`, the repo rejects the merge._

### Layer 3: Remote Verification (Standard CI)

- **Goal**: Post-Mortem Debugging.
- **Tool**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI.
- **Configuration**: Run full standard tests (Jest/Pytest) with verbose logging.
- **Note**: Keep AiVerify **local**. Use the verbose CI logs only for deep debugging when things go wrong.

### 🌍 Beyond Node.js: Python & Rust

AiVerify isn't just for JavaScript. It's a universal adapter for AI-friendly verification.

- **Python**: Automatically detects `pytest` or `requirements.txt`.
- **Rust (Blazing Fast)**: Wraps `cargo test` and `cargo check`.
  - _Benchmark_: Local verification with AiVerify took **<30 seconds**, compared to **5+ minutes** for equivalent cloud CI runs.

### A Note on "AI Instructions"

**We do NOT recommend adding specific instructions for AiVerify to your Agent's system prompt.**
Our research shows that Agents perform best when the environment _forces_ compliance naturally. By setting up Layer 1 (Husky) and Layer 2 (Repo Rules), the Agent encounters a "Physics of the Repo" that it must respect, without needing confusing meta-instructions.
